# HMLR-2025-Data-Scientist-Challenge

This project was developed as part of the **HMLR (HM Land Registry) 2025 Data Scientist Challenge**, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) techniques applied to textual data, using Python and popular libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to:
- Preprocess and analyze text data using NLP techniques.
- Extract meaningful features from the text using TF-IDF.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for classification tasks.

---

##  Features & Techniques

- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Tokenization with NLTK
  - Stopword removal
  - Lemmatization
  - POS tagging
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - Frequency-based feature extraction

- **Modeling**:
  - Train/test split
  - Model evaluation with cross-validation

##  File Structure

- `Vishnu_Tekuru_BBC.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all code, comments, and outputs.
- `Vishnu_Tekuru_BBc.py`: consists the python code to copy and execute

##  Requirements

To run this notebook, you need Python 3 and the following packages:

```
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn

```
***You also need to Change the path before Executing the code according to you path as I performed my local machine***
